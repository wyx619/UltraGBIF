Description: Global Biodiversity Information Facility is the largest biodiversity data repository around the world, hosting over 3 billion records. However, processing massive records typically involves cumbersome workflows and time-consuming operations, posing significant challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present UltraGBIF, which is an ultrafast and convenient R package designed for efficient processing of GBIF records.
