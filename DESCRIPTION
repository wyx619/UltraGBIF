Description: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is the largest biodiversity data repository around the world, hosting over 3 billion records. However, data integration from heterogeneous databases often introduces redundancy and errors, which can compromise the accuracy of species richness measurements and subsequently affect ecological, biogeographic, and evolutionary studies. Moreover, processing massive occurrence datasets typically involves cumbersome workflows and time-consuming operations, posing significant challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present UltraGBIF â€“ an ultrafast and convenient R package designed for efficient processing of GBIF records.
