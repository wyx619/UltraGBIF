### An ultra-fast and user-friendly R package for compiling quality filtered plant occurrence records from GBIF

## Introduction

Mapping plant distributions is fundamental to understanding biodiversity
patterns, accurate distribution data and such information is necessary
for researching plant diversity. Global Biodiversity Information
Facility, known as [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), is a large repository
for plant occurrence records worldwide. It has fueled over 18,200
peer-reviewed journal articles, with ecology (3,769 researches), climate
change (2,953), conservation (1,915), and invasive species management
(1,840) as of August 2025, supporting global policy frameworks like the
Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

Researchers using GBIF occurrence records usually rely on a suite of
packages and scrips, consuming lots of runtime, Such as
[`rgbif`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.rgbif),
[`TNRS`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.TNRS),
[`CoordinateCleaner`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.CoordinateCleaner),
[`bdc`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.bdc),
[`plantR`](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13779),
[`NSR`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.NSR) and
[`GVS`](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.GVS) help to deal with
GBIF occurrence records. Moreover, for million records datasets, current
methods incur substantial computational overhead through manual chaining
of disparate packages, necessitating high-performance infrastructure
despite advancing computational capabilities.

To rectify this situation, we introduce UltraGBIF, an efficient R
package that unifies taxonomic resolution, spatial validation, duplicate
consolidation, and botanical region annotation within a high-performance
framework. Its optimized C/C++ backend and intelligent parallelization
enable compiling one million GBIF occurrence records on a laptop within
15 minutes. In a word, UltraGBIF resolves challenges in reproducibility,
scalability, and spatial-taxonomic integrity without increasing adoption
barriers for biodiversity researchers.

## Workflow

***Three main stages and seven modules of UltraGBIF.** After all stages,
generally 35% of the initial occurrence records are retained.*

UltraGBIF provides a reproducible, plant-optimized, and computationally
efficient framework for transforming raw GBIF occurrence records into
analysis-ready datasets. The package functions are categorized into
three main stages and seven distinct modules.

**Stage 1: Data Acquisition**

This stage ensures data accuracy and consistency through three modules:

1.  Import Data: This module receives a user-provided Darwin Core
    Archive that adheres to GBIF data conventions. The DwC-A is loaded
    locally (e.g., occurrences.csv/zip) and any extensions described by
    meta.xml. GBIF-reported issue flags are automatically extracted for
    downstream quality assessment.

2.  Check Taxon Name: This module implements taxonomic name
    standardization to resolve and validate plant names. User may select
    between the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP; Govaerts et
    al., 2021) and the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS, Boyle et
    al. 2013). This step unifies synonyms and corrects misspellings.

3.  Check Collector Name: This module standardizes collector names to
    reduce inconsistencies (e.g., “Smith, J.” versus “J. Smith”) that
    can fragment single collection events. By preparing a standardized
    dictionary of primary collector surnames, this step reduces
    identification errors by over 80% and improves the accuracy of
    subsequent duplication checks.

**Stage 2: Duplicate Removal and Reliability Filtering**

This stage improves data reliability by identifying high-quality,
non-redundant occurrence records.

4.  Generate Unique Collection Mark: This module identifies and
    consolidates duplicates into unique collection events. A collection
    event represents a distinct sampling instance (a specific collector
    at a specific time and place).

5.  Set Digital Voucher: For duplicate entries sharing a collection
    mark, the record with the highest metadata quality is retained as
    the “digital voucher.” This approach preserves the most
    geographically informative data while minimizing redundancy, thereby
    improving the spatially reliability.

**Stage 3: Refine Records**

The final stage restores key information, enhances geospatial accuracy,
and enables visualization.

6.  Refine records: This module validates spatial information and
    restores detailed metadata for usable vouchers. It performs
    automated coordinate validation using CoordinateCleaner (Zizka et
    al., 2019) to flag spatial errors (e.g., centroids, capitals,
    institutions). It also extracts information from WCVP to annotate
    records as ‘native’, ‘introduced’, or ‘doubtful’. The optional
    [`occTest`](https://github.com/pepbioalerts/occTest/blob/master/url)
    package (Serra-Diaz et al., 2024) is also compatible here for
    advanced quality control checks.

7.  Map records: An optional visualization module that renders verified
    records onto customizable, dynamic maps, providing an intuitive
    interface for viewing spatial distributions and data density.

Focused exclusively on GBIF plant occurrence records, UltraGBIF is able
to clean one million records within 15 minutes on a laptop, representing
60% memory reduction. In a word, UltraGBIF integrates these components
into a unified, automated workflow that enhances data standardization,
accuracy, and usability, which enables robust, reproducible, and
scalable compiling of GBIF occurrence records for advanced biodiversity
research.

> UltraGBIF is under development. If you encounter any bugs, please feel

> is greatly appreciated!

## Initial Installation

You can install UltraGBIF from GitHub. UltraGBIF runs with rWCVPdata, so
install it firstly (We recommend rWCVPdata version 0.6.0 with WCVP
version 14), and the initial installation takes some time.

``` r
options(repos = c(getOption("repos"),"https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Repo-902F"))
options(timeout = 600)
install.packages("rWCVPdata",type = 'source') ## install rWCVPdata [require long time]
install.packages("UltraGBIF",type = 'source') ## install UltraGBIF
```
